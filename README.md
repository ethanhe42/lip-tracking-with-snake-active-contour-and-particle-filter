### **Features**

I implemented some advanced features. My snake is particle filter enhanced.

- It can deal with sharp change, like in the middle of liptracking3.avi.
- It can track other face features: eyes
- For liptracking3 and liptracking4, my snake can track the full video.
- For liptracking2, maybe my snake will lose tracking lip at frame:1493, able to track lip about 200 frames (Uncertainty is because of partical filter). However, eyes can be tracked in the full video.

### **Results**

Tracking results are in avi format. After running the codes, they will be override by new results.

### **instuction on run the code**

To run the code, put images folders and all matlab scripts in the same folder. folder names should be `liptracking2,liptracking3,liptracking4`. There are two ways to run my code.

1. run `entry.m`, 3 online tracking will be done one by one.
2. call function `main.m` in the way as described in homeworkmain(foldername,root,startidx,endidx)

Real time processing is shown frame by frame, but it's a bit slow. So you you can wait until the program finished, then watch the results.After program finished there will be aÂ *video name*.avi for each testing sequence, for offline watching.
